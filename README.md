Use .NET 5 REST API and Angular

Prerequisites:
- Follow steps for using northwind sample database: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases

There are a server-side API in .NET 5 REST API and a client-side in Angular.  An interesting idea is to create a generic contoller and shared GET, POST, PUT & DELETE methods for derived controller for a specific model without implementing same methods.  It also allows to override if need.  It also uses the same idea in Angular service.

If any ideas/questions, please ask/share.
